# Email Campaign Read Rate Prediction #
This repository hosts Python code for my analysis on campaign email read rate. It is my template for data science interview challenges. 

## Description ##
The features are campaign-level information such as the domain from which the campaign email is sent out, campaign size, the average read rate over the domain, etc. Target is the read rate of each campaign. 
The analysis covers an EDA, a data cleaning process, a machine learning model, and then a model evaluation. The focus of such challenges is to unearth business insights within the time contraint of an interview, rather than to achieve a high accuracy.

## Requirements ##
* `Python` & the commonly used analytical packages `pandas`, `numpy`, `sci-kit learn`, and `matplotlib`.
